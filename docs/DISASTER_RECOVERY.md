## Disaster Scenario #1: Database Unavailable

**Symptoms:**
- Supabase dashboard shows "Database Unavailable"
- Application throws `ECONNREFUSED` errors
- Health check endpoint fails 3+ consecutive times

**Detection:**
```bash
# Health check command
curl -f https://grdgjhkygzciwwrxgvgy.supabase.co/rest/v1/ \
  -H "apikey: [ANON_KEY]" || echo "DATABASE DOWN"
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Supabase infrastructure outage (check https://status.supabase.com)
2. Database connection pool exhausted
3. Disk space full (>95% quota)
4. Database corruption

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Assess Impact (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check Supabase status page
curl -s https://status.supabase.com/api/v2/status.json | jq '.status.description'

# If "All Systems Operational" â†’ problem is on our side
# If degraded â†’ wait for Supabase recovery or proceed with restore
```

**STEP 2: Attempt Quick Fix (10 minutes)**
```sql
-- If database responds intermittently, try connection pool reset
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'idle' 
  AND state_change < NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';

-- Clear query cache
DISCARD ALL;

-- Vacuum dead tuples (if disk space issue)
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

**STEP 3: Restore from Backup (90 minutes)**

**3a. Create New Supabase Project (if catastrophic failure)**
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Create new project: bookingsassistant-recovery
# 2. Note new project URL and keys
# 3. Download latest backup
```

**3b. Restore Database**
```bash
# Download backup from Supabase (if available)
npx supabase db dump --remote --project-id grdgjhkygzciwwrxgvgy > backup.sql

# OR use our encrypted backup
gpg --decrypt backups/daily/2025-01-14/full-database.sql.gz.pgp | gunzip > backup.sql

# Restore to new database
psql "postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[NEW_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres" < backup.sql
```

**STEP 4: Update Application Configuration (15 minutes)**
```typescript
// Update src/integrations/supabase/client.ts
const SUPABASE_URL = "https://[NEW_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co";
const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "[NEW_ANON_KEY]";

// Redeploy application
git commit -am "Emergency: Switch to recovery database"
git push origin main
```

**STEP 5: Validation (10 minutes)**
```sql
-- Verify critical tables
SELECT 
  'users' AS table_name, 
  COUNT(*) AS row_count 
FROM users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'calendars', COUNT(*) FROM calendars
UNION ALL
SELECT 'bookings', COUNT(*) FROM bookings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'booking_payments', COUNT(*) FROM booking_payments;

-- Expected: Row counts match pre-disaster state (Â±5%)
```

**STEP 6: Smoke Test (10 minutes)**
- âœ… Log in as admin user
- âœ… View calendar page
- âœ… Create test booking
- âœ… Check payment history
- âœ… Send test WhatsApp message

**Rollback Plan:**
If restoration fails, switch back to original database URL:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

**Estimated Recovery Time: 2 hours**

**Post-Recovery Actions:**
- [ ] Document incident in post-mortem
- [ ] Update emergency contact list
- [ ] Review backup retention policy
- [ ] Schedule disaster recovery drill

## Disaster Scenario #2: Edge Function Timeout

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors
- Edge function logs show "Function invocation timed out"
- Users report "Server not responding" errors

**Detection:**
```typescript
// Monitor edge function health
const response = await fetch('https://grdgjhkygzciwwrxgvgy.supabase.co/functions/v1/health-check');
if (!response.ok || response.status === 504) {
  console.error('Edge function timeout detected');
}
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Cold start delays (function not invoked recently)
2. Inefficient database queries (missing indexes)
3. External API timeouts (Stripe, WhatsApp)
4. Memory limit exceeded (default 150MB)

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Identify Failing Function (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check edge function logs
# Via Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ [function-name] â†’ Logs
# Look for: "Function execution exceeded time limit"
```

**STEP 2: Quick Fix - Redeploy Function (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Redeploy function to reset state
cd supabase/functions/[function-name]
# Make trivial change (add comment)
git commit -am "Redeploy [function-name] to fix timeout"
git push origin main

# Lovable will auto-deploy the function
```

**STEP 3: Increase Memory/Timeout (if redeploy fails) (5 minutes)**
```toml
# supabase/config.toml
[functions.function-name]
verify_jwt = true
memory_mb = 512  # Increased from 150MB
timeout_ms = 30000  # Increased from 10000ms
```

**STEP 4: Optimize Query (if database-related) (30 minutes)**
```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_exec_time,
  mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_exec_time > 1000  -- >1 second
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Add missing indexes (see migration 20251014213639)
-- Restart edge function after index creation
```

**STEP 5: Validation (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Test edge function directly
curl -X POST https://grdgjhkygzciwwrxgvgy.supabase.co/functions/v1/[function-name] \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [ANON_KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'

# Expected: 200 OK response within 3 seconds
```

**Estimated Recovery Time: 15 minutes**

**Prevention:**
- Implement database query optimization (indexes created in latest migration)
- Use connection pooling for external APIs
- Add request timeout handling with graceful degradation

---

## Disaster Scenario #3: Stripe Webhook Failures

**Symptoms:**
- `webhook_events` table shows `status='failed'`
- Payments successful in Stripe Dashboard but not reflected in app
- Email notifications not sent for completed bookings

**Detection:**
```sql
-- Check for failed webhooks in last 24 hours
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS failed_webhook_count,
  event_type,
  error_message
FROM webhook_events
WHERE status = 'failed'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY event_type, error_message;
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Stripe webhook signature verification failed
2. Database write failed (RLS policy blocked insert)
3. n8n workflow not configured correctly
4. Network timeout between Stripe and Supabase

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Identify Failed Events (10 minutes)**
```sql
-- Get list of failed events with details
SELECT 
  id,
  event_type,
  stripe_event_id,
  error_message,
  created_at
FROM webhook_events
WHERE status = 'failed'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**STEP 2: Resend Webhooks from Stripe (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Via Stripe Dashboard
# 1. Go to Developers â†’ Webhooks â†’ [your-endpoint]
# 2. Click "Events" tab
# 3. Find failed events (filter by date)
# 4. Click "Resend" button for each failed event

# OR via Stripe CLI
stripe events resend evt_1ABC123...
```

**STEP 3: Verify Webhook Endpoint (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint directly
curl -X POST https://grdgjhkygzciwwrxgvgy.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook \
  -H "stripe-signature: [test-signature]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test-webhook-payload.json

# Expected: 200 OK response
```

**STEP 4: Update Payment Status Manually (if urgent) (20 minutes)**
```sql
-- For critical payments, manually update booking_payments table
UPDATE booking_payments
SET 
  status = 'succeeded',
  paid_at = NOW(),
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE stripe_payment_intent_id = 'pi_ABC123...'
  AND status = 'pending';

-- Send manual confirmation email (via n8n or admin panel)
```

**STEP 5: Fix Root Cause (30 minutes)**

**If signature verification failed:**
```typescript
// Update webhook secret in Supabase secrets
// Via Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Secrets
// Add or update: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_...

// Verify webhook endpoint URL in Stripe Dashboard matches:
// https://grdgjhkygzciwwrxgvgy.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

**If RLS policy blocked:**
```sql
-- Grant service role access to webhook_events
CREATE POLICY "service_role_all_webhook_events"
ON webhook_events
FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

**STEP 6: Validation (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Create test payment in Stripe Dashboard
# Verify webhook processed successfully
# Check booking_payments table updated
# Verify confirmation email sent
```

**Estimated Recovery Time: 30 minutes**

**Post-Recovery:**
- [ ] Review webhook logs for patterns
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts for failed webhooks
- [ ] Document webhook debugging procedure

---

## Disaster Scenario #4: Data Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- Checksum validation fails on export
- Foreign key violations detected
- Users report missing or incorrect data
- Orphaned records found in database

**Detection:**
```sql
-- Check for orphaned bookings (no matching calendar)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orphaned_bookings
FROM bookings b
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM calendars c WHERE c.id = b.calendar_id
);
-- Expected: 0

-- Check for orphaned payments (no matching booking)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orphaned_payments
FROM booking_payments bp
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM bookings b WHERE b.id = bp.booking_id
);
-- Expected: 0
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Failed migration left partial data
2. Application bug caused invalid writes
3. Manual database modification without constraints
4. Hardware failure (rare with Supabase)

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Assess Corruption Scope (15 minutes)**
```sql
-- Run comprehensive data integrity checks
-- Check all foreign key relationships
SELECT 
  tc.table_name,
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_schema = 'public';

-- For each relationship, verify no orphans exist
```

**STEP 2: Identify Corruption Timestamp (10 minutes)**
```sql
-- Find when corruption started by checking created_at/updated_at
SELECT 
  MIN(created_at) AS first_corrupt_record,
  MAX(created_at) AS last_corrupt_record,
  COUNT(*) AS total_corrupt_records
FROM [affected_table]
WHERE [corruption_condition];

-- Example: Bookings without matching calendars
SELECT 
  MIN(b.created_at),
  MAX(b.created_at),
  COUNT(*)
FROM bookings b
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM calendars c WHERE c.id = b.calendar_id);
```

**STEP 3: Point-in-Time Restore (90 minutes)**
```bash
# Restore database to timestamp BEFORE corruption
# Via Supabase Dashboard â†’ Database â†’ Backups
# 1. Select backup from before corruption timestamp
# 2. Click "Restore" (creates new project)
# 3. Migrate recent valid data manually

# OR use Supabase CLI
npx supabase db dump \
  --remote \
  --project-id grdgjhkygzciwwrxgvgy \
  --use-copy \
  --timestamp "2025-01-13 14:30:00+00" > pre-corruption-backup.sql
```

**STEP 4: Repair Corrupted Data (45 minutes)**

**Option A: Delete orphaned records (if non-critical)**
```sql
-- DELETE orphaned bookings (if calendar was legitimately deleted)
DELETE FROM bookings
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM calendars c WHERE c.id = calendar_id);

-- Verify deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings; -- Should match expected count
```

**Option B: Restore missing parent records (if data loss)**
```sql
-- Restore missing calendars from backup
INSERT INTO calendars (id, user_id, name, slug, ...)
SELECT id, user_id, name, slug, ...
FROM pre_corruption_backup.calendars
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT calendar_id FROM bookings
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM calendars c WHERE c.id = calendar_id)
);
```

**STEP 5: Validation (20 minutes)**
```sql
-- Re-run all integrity checks
-- Should return 0 for all queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings b
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM calendars c WHERE c.id = b.calendar_id);

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM booking_payments bp
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bookings b WHERE b.id = bp.booking_id);

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM whatsapp_messages wm
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM whatsapp_conversations wc WHERE wc.id = wm.conversation_id);

-- All should return 0
```

**STEP 6: Root Cause Analysis (60 minutes)**
```sql
-- Review recent migrations for issues
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
ORDER BY version DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check application logs for failed writes
-- Review security_events_log for anomalies
SELECT * FROM security_events_log
WHERE created_at > [corruption_timestamp]
  AND severity IN ('high', 'critical')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Estimated Recovery Time: 3 hours**

**Prevention:**
- âœ… Enable foreign key constraints on all tables
- âœ… Add database triggers for validation
- âœ… Implement application-level validation
- âœ… Run weekly data integrity checks

---

## Disaster Scenario #5: WhatsApp Integration Down

**Symptoms:**
- No WhatsApp messages received for 10+ minutes
- QR code won't scan
- `whatsapp_conversations` table shows `status='inactive'`
- Users report "WhatsApp bot not responding"

**Detection:**
```sql
-- Check for recent WhatsApp activity
SELECT 
  MAX(created_at) AS last_message_time,
  NOW() - MAX(created_at) AS time_since_last_message
FROM whatsapp_messages;

-- Alert if time_since_last_message > 10 minutes during business hours
```

**Root Causes:**
1. WhatsApp session expired (phone disconnected)
2. n8n workflow stopped or erroring
3. WhatsApp Business API rate limit exceeded
4. Phone number changed or deactivated

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Verify n8n Workflow Status (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check n8n workflow logs
# Via n8n Dashboard â†’ Workflows â†’ WhatsApp Booking Assistant
# Look for: "Workflow execution failed" or "Connection timeout"

# Test n8n webhook endpoint
curl -X POST [N8N_WEBHOOK_URL] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "message"}'

# Expected: 200 OK response
```

**STEP 2: Regenerate WhatsApp QR Code (10 minutes)**
```sql
-- Update calendar_settings to trigger QR regeneration
UPDATE calendar_settings
SET 
  whatsapp_qr_url = NULL,
  whatsapp_qr_generated_at = NULL,
  whatsapp_bot_active = false
WHERE calendar_id = [affected_calendar_id];

-- Application will auto-generate new QR on next page load
-- User must scan QR with WhatsApp to reconnect
```

**STEP 3: Reconnect WhatsApp Device (15 minutes)**
```
1. Navigate to Calendar Settings â†’ WhatsApp Integration
2. Click "Disconnect WhatsApp" (if currently showing connected)
3. Click "Generate QR Code"
4. Scan QR code with phone (WhatsApp â†’ Settings â†’ Linked Devices â†’ Link a Device)
5. Wait for "Connected" status
6. Send test message to verify
```

**STEP 4: Validation (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Send test message to WhatsApp number
# Verify message appears in whatsapp_messages table
# Check n8n workflow executed successfully
# Verify auto-reply sent

# SQL validation
SELECT * FROM whatsapp_messages
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Estimated Recovery Time: 20 minutes**

**Prevention:**
- Monitor `whatsapp_bot_active` status daily
- Set up alerts for session disconnections
- Document QR reconnection procedure for users
- Implement automatic session refresh (if WhatsApp API supports)

**Symptoms:**
- `charges_enabled=false` in `business_stripe_accounts` table
- Payment attempts fail with "Account suspended" error
- Stripe Dashboard shows "Action Required" banner
- Users can't receive payments

**Detection:**
```sql
-- Check for suspended Stripe accounts
SELECT 
  calendar_id,
  stripe_account_id,
  account_status,
  charges_enabled,
  payouts_enabled
FROM business_stripe_accounts
WHERE charges_enabled = false
  OR account_status = 'suspended';
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Missing verification documents (ID, business proof)
2. High dispute/refund rate (>1%)
3. Terms of Service violation
4. Suspicious transaction patterns

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Identify Suspension Reason (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Via Stripe Dashboard
# 1. Log in to Stripe Connect account
# 2. Check "Account Status" banner for details
# 3. Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Account" for requirements

# Common reasons:
# - "Verification documents needed"
# - "High dispute rate detected"
# - "Unusual activity pattern"
```

**STEP 4: Implement Temporary Workaround (2 hours)**

**Option A: Enable Manual Payment Collection**
```sql
-- Disable payment requirement temporarily
UPDATE payment_settings
SET payment_required_for_booking = false
WHERE calendar_id IN (
  SELECT calendar_id FROM business_stripe_accounts
  WHERE charges_enabled = false
);

-- Notify affected users via email
INSERT INTO webhook_events (event_type, calendar_id, event_data)
SELECT 
  'stripe_account_suspended',
  calendar_id,
  jsonb_build_object(
    'stripe_account_id', stripe_account_id,

## Disaster Scenario #7: Security Breach (Unauthorized Access)

**Symptoms:**
- Anomalous `login_history` entries (unusual IP addresses)
- Unexpected admin role assignments in `user_roles` table
- Data modifications not authorized by legitimate users
- Multiple failed login attempts followed by success

**Detection:**
```sql
-- Check for suspicious login activity
SELECT 
  user_id,
  ip_address,
  location_country,
  login_time,
  risk_score
FROM login_history
WHERE (
  risk_score > 70 
  OR location_country NOT IN ('NL', 'BE', 'DE')  -- Adjust for your expected countries
  OR flagged_as_suspicious = true
)
  AND login_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY login_time DESC;
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Compromised user credentials (phishing attack)
2. SQL injection vulnerability (rare with Supabase)
3. Stolen session token
4. Insider threat

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Immediate Containment (5 minutes)**
```sql
-- Revoke all active sessions for affected user
UPDATE user_sessions
SET 
  is_active = false,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = [compromised_user_id]
  AND is_active = true;

-- Force password reset
UPDATE user_security_settings
SET 
  force_password_change = true,
  password_changed_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = [compromised_user_id];
```

**STEP 2: Audit Unauthorized Actions (20 minutes)**
```sql
-- Review all actions by compromised account
SELECT 
  event_type,
  event_category,
  severity,
  event_data,
  created_at
FROM security_events_log
WHERE user_id = [compromised_user_id]
  AND created_at > [suspected_breach_timestamp]
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check for data modifications
SELECT 
  table_name,
  operation,
  old_data,
  new_data,
  performed_at
FROM audit_trail  -- If implemented
WHERE performed_by = [compromised_user_id]
  AND performed_at > [suspected_breach_timestamp];
```

**STEP 3: Rollback Unauthorized Changes (30 minutes)**
```sql
-- Revert unauthorized role assignments
DELETE FROM user_roles
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT jsonb_extract_path_text(event_data, 'target_user_id')::uuid
  FROM security_events_log
  WHERE user_id = [compromised_user_id]
    AND event_type = 'role_assigned'
    AND created_at > [breach_timestamp]
);

-- Restore modified data from backup (if available)
-- See Disaster Scenario #4 for data restoration steps
```

**STEP 4: Notify Affected Users (15 minutes)**
```sql
-- Send security breach notification emails
INSERT INTO webhook_events (event_type, event_data)
VALUES (
  'security_breach_notification',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'affected_users', ARRAY[...],
    'breach_type', 'unauthorized_access',
    'actions_taken', 'sessions_revoked_password_reset_required',
    'sent_at', NOW()
  )
);
```

**STEP 5: Forensic Analysis (60 minutes)**
```sql
-- Collect evidence for analysis
SELECT 
  lh.user_id,
  lh.ip_address,
  lh.user_agent,
  lh.login_time,
  lh.device_fingerprint,
  COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY lh.ip_address) AS logins_from_ip
FROM login_history lh
WHERE lh.login_time > [breach_timestamp] - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY lh.login_time DESC;

-- Export for security team review
\copy (SELECT * FROM security_events_log WHERE created_at > [breach_timestamp]) TO 'breach_evidence.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

**STEP 6: Implement Additional Security Measures (Ongoing)**
```sql
-- Enable 2FA for all admin users
UPDATE user_security_settings
SET two_factor_required = true
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT user_id FROM user_roles WHERE role = 'admin'
);

-- Implement IP allowlisting for admin access (if applicable)
-- Increase password strength requirements
-- Schedule security audit
```

**Estimated Recovery Time: 1 hour (containment), 24 hours (full forensics)**

**Post-Incident:**
- [ ] File incident report
- [ ] Review access control policies
- [ ] Conduct security training for team
- [ ] Consider penetration testing

## Disaster Scenario #8: Database Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:**
- Query execution time >1 second
- Application feels slow and unresponsive
- Supabase Dashboard shows high CPU usage (>80%)
- Connection pool warnings

**Detection:**
```sql
-- Identify slow queries
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_exec_time / 1000 AS total_seconds,
  mean_exec_time / 1000 AS avg_seconds,
  max_exec_time / 1000 AS max_seconds
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_exec_time > 1000  -- >1 second average
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Recovery Procedure:**

**STEP 1: Immediate Performance Boost (15 minutes)**
```sql
-- Terminate long-running queries
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active'
  AND query_start < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
  AND query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_activity%';

-- Vacuum and analyze tables
VACUUM ANALYZE;

-- Rebuild bloated indexes
REINDEX DATABASE postgres;
```

**STEP 2: Add Missing Indexes (30 minutes)**
```sql
-- Already implemented in migration 20251014213639
-- If new slow queries identified, create targeted indexes

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_custom_slow_query
ON [table_name]([column1], [column2]);

-- Use CONCURRENTLY to avoid table locks
```

**STEP 3: Optimize Query Plans (45 minutes)**
```sql
-- Analyze specific slow query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
[slow_query_here];

-- Look for:
-- - "Seq Scan" on large tables (needs index)
-- - "Nested Loop" with high cost (needs join optimization)
-- - "Sort" operations (consider indexed column order)

-- Rewrite inefficient queries
-- Example: Replace NOT EXISTS with LEFT JOIN
```

**Estimated Recovery Time: 45 minutes**
