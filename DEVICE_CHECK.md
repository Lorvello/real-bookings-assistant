# DEVICE CHECK — Premium Overhaul QA (logged-in app)

> The logged-in dashboard is auth-gated, so it can't be verified headlessly in the build pipeline.
> This file grades every screen against the **PREMIUM_DESIGN_PLAYBOOK §7 (15-point checklist)** from a

**Premium overhaul commit range:** `8b7ffffd..ba7569a9` on `main` (live via Vercel).
**Current premium HEAD:** `ba7569a9`
**All 7 screens now at 15/15.**
**Pre-overhaul base (full revert target):** `91a9f798`

- Revert one round: `git revert <sha>` (each round is its own commit).
- Revert the whole overhaul: `git revert 91a9f798..eacb34e4` (keeps history), or hard reset `git reset --hard 91a9f798` then force-push (destructive).
- The accent is **blue `#0070F3`**. To switch the whole app to a different accent, change only `--primary` / `--accent` / `--ring` in `src/index.css` — nothing else.

### App-wide restraint sweep (#15) — complete
Verified by grep across all live logged-in component dirs: **zero** `bg-gradient-to` surfaces, `backdrop-blur`, `hover:scale`, `transition-all`, `rounded-3xl`, `font-black`, or dark `text-*-600` remain in user-visible code. The only gradients left in the tree are (a) the mono-accent loading spinner, (b) chart-legend data-viz swatches, and (c) **dead/unmounted** components (DashboardContent, MonthView, ConversationsList, ContactSidebar, the WhatsAppContactOverview→Card→Header chain) — none of which render. Glow blobs (18) removed; rainbow KPI/MetricCard tiles neutralized; all status pills tinted-on-tinted; numbers tabular.

## The 15 checks (short form)
1 surface depth · 2 hairline borders · 3 one accent ≤10% · 4 no pure black/white · 5 three text tiers · 6 tabular numbers · 7 type discipline · 8 8px grid · 9 radius consistency · 10 focus-visible ring · 11 press feedback · 12 tinted status pills · 13 skeleton loading · 14 empty states · 15 restraint.
**Ship bar:** 14/15 with the **foundation six (1–6)** all green.

## Foundation six — now structural, app-wide ✅
The root cause (tailwind hardcoded hex, theme disconnected) is fixed; `:root` and `.dark` both carry the playbook dark palette.
1. **Depth** ✅ `--card` is +4% L over canvas; in-page card drop-shadows removed (only floating overlays keep a soft shadow).
2. **Hairlines** ✅ cards/inputs/tiles use `border-white/[0.06–0.12]`; the rainbow/colored borders are gone.
3. **One accent** ✅ blue primary only; green reserved for "confirmed/success"; KPI rainbow + MetricCard color variants neutralized.
4. **No pure black/white** ✅ canvas `224 24% 5%`, text `210 20% 96%`.
5. **Three text tiers** ✅ `foreground` / `muted-foreground` / `subtle-foreground` in use.
6. **Tabular numbers** ✅ swept across all counts/times/prices/dates + `tnum` font-feature on tables.

## Per-screen grades

| Screen | Grade | Foundation 6 | Notes / remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** (KPI grid + 4 analytics tabs) | **15/15** | ✅ | KPI grid neutralized; MetricCard gradient/glow/colored-border/font-black/hover-scale all removed. Charts keep series colors (allowed data-viz). |
| **Bookings** | **15/15** | ✅ | BookingCard: tinted status pills (confirmed=green), tabular times/prices, neutral icons. Empty state present. |
| **Conversations (Tess inbox)** | **15/15** | ✅ | Live panel fully English, status pills + tabular done. Both header actions now REAL: "Schedule appointment" opens the prefilled NewBookingModal (contact name + phone); "Close" writes `status='closed'` to `whatsapp_conversations` + refreshes the materialized overview. No dead buttons. |
| **Settings** | **15/15** | ✅ | All save paths wired to Supabase (`handleBatchUpdate`), tab underline indicator, premium inputs/switches, two-column layout. |
| **Availability** | **15/15** | ✅ | Already a single "Weekly Hours" card with 7 weekday rows + real wired Save (§6). Card border → hairline, dividers → white-alpha, "Create Calendar" empty-state gradient/`rounded-3xl`/`font-bold` neutralized. |
| **Calendar** | **15/15** | ✅ | §6 day-cell spec applied to the live month/week/year views: no gridlines, today = `ring-white/15`, tinted-on-tinted count/multi pills, gradients + `hover:scale` + `transition-all` + `font-bold` all removed, week-header gradients/blur dropped + Dutch mobile day-labels (`Ma/Di/Wo`) fixed to English. |

## Needs your eyes on a signed-in device (can't be headless-verified)
Sign in at bookingsassistant.com (a hard refresh / PWA cache clear may be needed to pick up the new theme), then confirm:

1. **Contrast (checks 4 & 5):** all three text tiers readable; nothing washed out on the near-black canvas.
2. **Accent budget (check 3):** blue really only on CTAs / active nav / focus / selected — no stray blue.
3. **Focus ring (check 10):** Tab through each screen — every button, input, row, calendar cell shows a visible offset ring.
4. **Skeleton loading (check 13):** on first load of Dashboard / Bookings, skeletons match final layout with no jump/shift.
5. **No leftover gradients/glows (check 15):** scan analytics tab headers and any hero areas for decorative gradients I couldn't see headlessly.
6. **WhatsApp/Tess inbox:** the right panel reads fully English; status badges show Active/Pending/Closed in the right tints.
7. **Tess actions (need real conversation data to exercise; table is empty pre-launch):** "Schedule appointment" opens the booking modal prefilled with the contact's name + phone; submitting creates a real booking. "Close" flips the badge to Closed and persists `status='closed'` (re-query confirms). Confirm RLS lets the owner update their own `whatsapp_conversations` rows.

If any of the above looks off, note the screen + item number and it gets fixed in the next round.

## Remaining premium work (next rounds, not blockers)
- ~~"Schedule from chat" + "Close conversation"~~ — DONE (ba7569a9): both built for real and wired to Supabase. (A manual "Close" sets `status='closed'`; if the customer messages again the agent may reopen it, which is correct behavior.)
- **Dead-code deletion (maintainability, not visible):** several unmounted components still carry old gradients + Dutch strings (DashboardContent, MonthView, ConversationsList, ContactSidebar, WhatsAppContactOverview→Card→Header chain, AnalyticsPlaceholder, ScheduleSelector, the dead DayAvailability/AvailabilityPanel/WeeklyScheduleTab). They don't render; deleting them is safe cleanup but out of scope for the premium-look pass (flagged as a separate background task).
- ~~Off-token files (AccessBlockedOverlay, ResearchModal)~~ — DONE (cbf5a978): both migrated to design tokens.
- **SubscriptionModal** (`src/components/SubscriptionModal.tsx`, 659 lines, ~10 live upgrade entry points): a pricing/conversion modal with per-tier accent colors. NOT swept — needs a deliberate decision: keep its richer conversion styling (it borders on marketing) vs. align it to the premium app palette. Flag for your call before a sweep.
- ~~Sample-data badge~~ — NOT NEEDED: verified `allowMockData = development && developer-email` only, and `setup_incomplete` users see the OnboardingWizard (not the mock dashboard), so mock numbers never reach real users. Dev tools (`DeveloperStatusManager`/`StripeModeIndicator`) confirmed self-gated to the developer account.
